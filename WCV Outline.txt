WCV Outline and parts needed:
- Scraper
	- basics done, but needs to be dynamic
	- ideally take in at least the following (or a subset)
		- start page
		- end page
		- content location
		- next / prev page location
			- some require for prefixes to be added to find
		- filename prefix (account for number)
		- title location
		- dest file format
		* location refers to div, class, id, or tag
	- for now, also add an admin access to directly call functions
	- scrape first three pages as test, and display before scraping all requested
	(-) options for metadata info
- Loader
	- current does load desired filenames, but to single list
		- edit: try checking the 307 grading files for this code snippet
	- add checks for filename prefixes, file types, num files, etc.
	- structure options:
		- single list: less initial overhead, but a lot of filtering later
		- list of lists: allows for division by chapter or other index, but not even
		- dictionary: decent mix of two above, but must develop good index system
			- probably chapter.page, or global page
	(-) loading metadata from designated file
- Metadata management
	- chapter demarcations
	- chapter titles
	- file structure (eg. nested folders, filename notations, etc.)
	- bookmarks
	- num files
- Features
	- zoom in / zoom out
	- full screen
	- view one, all, chapter
	- jump to page, chapter
	- bookmarks
	- background color (use set list)
	- favorites list
- Viewer GUI
	- must account for features
	- Scraper GUI: simple (series of) dialog box(es) to prompt for scraper inputs
	- Loader GUI: dialog box with options to chose what to load
