# WebComicViewerPY
This project is comprised of two main parts: a scraper and a viewer.  While they can be run seperately, the viewer 
has the ability to run the scraper when needed, and are thus two parts of the same project.  

## Viewer
__Located in `reader.py`.__

Run to start the viewer.  Starts in the main page to the viewer, and from there, can load, scrape, favorite/unfavorite comics, etc.

*Original, abandoned JavaFX version of viewer can be found [here](https://github.com/Shanshan-/WebComicViewer)*

## Scraper
__Located in `gen_scraper.py`.__

Run to start the scraper.  Fill in fileds accodingly, or if using a prebuilt profile, modify accordingly, then run.

*`scraper.py` holds test code from designing the scraper, and does nothing of use in current iteration of project.*
